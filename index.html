                <p>The Freedom Rides, which began in the summer of 1961, were a significant moment during the Civil Rights movement. Spurred on by a series of Supreme Court cases preceding that summer, a group of students, congressional members, activists, and civilians—organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)—banded together to force the Jim Crowe South to comply with the growing number of federal desegregation laws. Their goal: to influence federal intervention in the South to get them to adhere to desegregation of interstate transportation via nonviolent protest.</p>
                <p>Desegregation of interstate transportation began in 1954 with the Supreme Court decision of <i>Keys v. Carolina Coach Co.</i>, where a Black woman and Women’s Army Corps private Susan Louise Keys sued the Carolina Coach Company after a bus driver forced her to sit at the back of the bus during a trip from New Jersey to North Carolina. When she refused, she was arrested. The “separate but equal” mentality had been the legal precedent in the country since <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> and <i>Henderson v. United States</i> in the 1950s. <i>Keys v. Carolina Coach Co.</i> was the first time that the Supreme Court had departed from the separate but equal doctrine. However, the Jim Crowe South still refused to do away with state segregation laws, despite the federal rulings. Following <i>Keys v. Carolina Coach Co.</i>, a series of Supreme Court cases, including <i>Morgan v. Virginia</i> and <i>Boynton v. Virginia</i> continued to expand desegregation of interstate travel, but southern states held firm. </p>
                <p>Inspired by the Journey of Reconciliation, The original CORE Freedom Ride was comprised of 13 members who rode Greyhound and Trailways interstate buses from Washington D.C. to New Orleans between May 14–16, 1961. The goal was to reach New Orleans in time for the anniversary celebration of the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision in time. They planned to test the 1960 Supreme Court’s<i> Boynton v. Virginia</i> case, which extended the segregation ban to bus terminals, restrooms, and other interstate travel facilities. CORE recruited and trained the first Freedom Riders: seven African American individuals, and six White individuals. Along the way, the group was met with extreme racial violence and little to no protection from local police and federal officials, including then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who called for restraint out of fear for the Freedom Riders’ safety. However, the Riders’ commitment to civil rights and nonviolence inspired not just the original 13 members but 13 subsequent Freedom Rides across the country between April–December 1961.</p>
                <p>By the end of 1961, AG Kennedy had forced the Interstate Commerce Commission to enforce its own desegregation laws in Southern States. The Freedom Riders had paid for the desegregation of transportation across the entire country with their blood, sweat, and tears in one of the strongest cases of nonviolent protest in American history. However, the Civil Rights Movement still had a long way to go. The collective action of the Freedom Rides and the laws that inspired it did not solve the problem of systemized racism in America. The Jim Crow South, as well as many northern states, still attempted to subvert desegregation in many ways. In fact, at the end of 1961, even as AG Kennedy and the Kennedy Administration were attempting to strong arm states into compliance, 15 Episcopal priests were arrested in a Jackson, Mississippi bus terminal for attempting to enter an adjoining segregated coffee shop. They were all beaten and arrested by local police. And the resulting 1967 decision of their Supreme Court case <i>Pierson v. Ray</i> led to legal precedent for what we now know as qualified immunity.</p>

While Kennedy pleaded for restraint with the Freedom Riders due to concerns for their safety, the committment of the supporters to continuing their protests until southern states complied forced Kennedy&apos;s hand after a series of appeasment measures between the protestors and the state governments. On May 29, 1961, Kennedy petitioned the ICC to implement and enforce its own desegregation ruling in <i>Keys v. Carolina Coach Company</i>. Three months after Kennedy&apos;s petition, protestors threatened to bring their cause to the streets of Washington D.C. to protest both the ICC and the Kennedy administration, which they called the Washington Project. However, the new ICC policies went into effect November 1, 1961, and the Washington Project never occurred.',

After their criminal case was dismissed, the group sued the police who arrested them for civil damages. After the case was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, the court found in favor of the police, thereby creating a legal precedent for "qualified immunity" for police officers, thereby drawing a direct line from the era of legal segregation to the era of legal protection of police violence. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierson_v._Ray" target="_blank">Learn more</a>',

Civil rights activists and future senators John Lewis and Al Bigelow were violently attacked by a group of white men after entering a white waiting area at a Greyhound terminal. A white police officer intervened, but after the mob dispersed, the Freedom Riders declined to press charges.

The peaceful protestors had support from leaders like Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Although some of the members did suffer personal loses during this time. And after four days of travel as they entered into Alabama, spirits were high, until word started circulating that a particularly well-coordinated group of Klansmen were planning on thwarting the Freedom Riders in some way. As the Freedom Riders entered into Anniston, Alabama on their way from Atlanta, Georgia, the city bus terminal was empty and streets seemingly deserted. As the bus drove up to the station, a white mob of about 50 led by Klan leader William Chappell destroyed the bus, slashing tires, breaking windows, and bashing in the sides. Police arrived at the scene but arrested no one and led a police escort out to the city limits, where the mob promptly began their assualt again. Finally, a man named Cecil Lewallyn threw a molotov cocktail through one of the broken windows, engulfing the bus in smoke. Incredibly, all passengers were able to evacuate. During the evacuation, several of the Freedom Riders were assaulted, including Hank Thomas, who was left unconscious after being hit with a baseball bat by one of the white men. Freedom Rider Ell Cowling held their only defense in the form of a pistol, as the police sat looking on at the scene but did not attempt to make any arrests or even write down license numbers of any of the assailants&apos; cars. Finally, after police fired a shotgun into the air to disperse the crowds as the bus was engulfed in flames, the Riders were transported to the Anniston Memorial Hospital, where they were refused treatment by hospital administration and an aggitated crowd grew outside of the hospital. Luckily, a call was made to Deacon Fred Shuttlesworth, who was able to organize a rescue mission of eight cars to transport the Riders from what very well could have turned into a lynching to safety in Birmingham.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Riders-Struggle-Justice-American/dp/0195327144" target="_blank">Learn more</a>',

When they entered Anniston, they began to see the wreckage of the violence done to the Greyhound bus. The bus driver John Olan Patterson stopped the bus and ordered the Black passengers to teh back of the bus. When the Freedom Riders refused, the driver and the Klansmen began attacking the Riders on the bus. The Riders held to their promise of non-violence and sat silent while the white mob beat them and dragged them to the back of the bus. After the violence, the driver avoided the Anniston mob by taking Alabama backroads to Birmingham, where an even larger, more violent obstacle waited for them. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Riders-Struggle-Justice-American/dp/0195327144" target="_blank">Learn more</a>',

The entire assualt was over in 20 minutes, and the Freedom Riders were left to cobble together transportation from any sympathetic cab drivers to Shuttlesworth&apos;s parsonage to reunite with the Greyhound Riders.

Kennedy, and head of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover, a flurry of political activity ensued the following day. The Kennedys attempted to negotiate with the Alabama governor Patterson to ensure safe passage for the Freedom Riders in their continued journey to New Orleans. However, most of the political action pursued on the Riders&apos; behalf stemmed mostly from political motivation, not from a civil rights perspective. When the governor refused to provide protection for the Riders, coupled with Greyhound and Trailway&apos;s refusal to provide drivers to operate the buses after the previous day&apos;s violence, the Riders felt they had no choice but to leave Alabama altogether. They flew from Birmingham to New Orleans in order to attend the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> commemoration rally in New Orleans on May 17. However, the Riders found themselves trapped for hours at the Birmingham airport when every flight they attempted to board prompted bomb threats to the airport. Eventually, the Kennedy administration sent a representative down to Birmingham in an attempt to "smuggle" the Riders out of Alabama. Eventually, the Riders were able to leave after coordination between the airlines and traffic control managed to announce departure of the flight at the last minute, sidestepping any potential bomb threats. All 14 Freedom Riders were free from Alabama miraculously with their lives, and landed in New Orleans, relieved, traumatized, and with renewed support from the federal government that would lead to Robert Kennedy&apos;s crusade to bring institutions across the country to comply with the era of desegregation.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Riders-Struggle-Justice-American/dp/0195327144" target="_blank"> Learn more</a>',

Their mission was to protest racial segregation in bus terminals along the way. At the Airport in Tallahassee, Florida the restaurant closes before the freedom Riders arrive. Some Riders fly back to their homes, but others stay to try to eat in the restaurant. After attempting to eat in the restaurant, 10 Freedom Riders are arrested (popularly known as the “Tallahassee Ten”) and their legal appeals drag on for years.

Amidst rising fears among local whites, the MNAC organized its first demonstration on Monday, August 21, when ten activists—six Freedom Riders, three local blacks, and Constance Lever, a young English anti-apartheid activist—set up a picket line outside the Union County Courthouse in downtown Monroe. Carrying signs proclaiming “Freedom for All,” the picketers remained at the courthouse for several hours without incident. When they returned the next day, however, a small but angry crowd of whites provoked a melee that resulted in several beatings and the arrest of four picketers, including Richard Griswold, a white Freedom Rider from Brooklyn who took an “unauthorized” picture of Paul Dietrich being beaten.',
