While Kennedy pleaded for restraint with the Freedom Riders due to concerns for their safety, the committment of the supporters to continuing their protests until southern states complied forced Kennedy&apos;s hand after a series of appeasment measures between the protestors and the state governments. On May 29, 1961, Kennedy petitioned the ICC to implement and enforce its own desegregation ruling in <i>Keys v. Carolina Coach Company</i>. Three months after Kennedy&apos;s petition, protestors threatened to bring their cause to the streets of Washington D.C. to protest both the ICC and the Kennedy administration, which they called the Washington Project. However, the new ICC policies went into effect November 1, 1961, and the Washington Project never occurred.',

However, the case was tried as a continuation of southern states&apos; failure to comply with federal desegregation laws. On September 13, 1961, 15 Episcopal priests, including 3 Black priests, were arrested for entering a "whites only" coffee shop at a bus terminal in Jackson, Mississippi. After their criminal case was dismissed, the group sued the police who arrested them for civil damages. After the case was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, the court found in favor of the police, thereby creating a legal precedent for "qualified immunity" for police officers, thereby drawing a direct line from the era of legal segregation to the era of legal protection of police violence. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierson_v._Ray" target="_blank">Learn more</a>',

When police came to arrest Thomas, Peck attempted to persuade the officers that they had a constitutional right to eat at the restaurant. The charges were dropped against Thomas, who rejoined the Freedom riders days later, but the police dropped Peck&apos;s interference charges for a state liquor violation for untaxed alcohol after Peck had brought a bottle of whiskey he purchased in North Carolina on the trip with him. He was bailed out by other CORE members but fled the state to rejoin the others before charges were dropped. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Riders-Struggle-Justice-American/dp/0195327144" target="_blank">Learn more</a>',

                        description: 'The Freedom riders&apos;s journey was eventful at the level of notoriety, but uneventful in terms of violence or arrests. The peaceful protestors had support from leaders like Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Although some of the members did suffer personal loses during this time. And after four days of travel as they entered into Alabama, spirits were high, until word started circulating that a particularly well-coordinated group of Klansmen were planning on thwarting the Freedom Riders in some way. As the Freedom Riders entered into Anniston, Alabama on their way from Atlanta, Georgia, the city bus terminal was empty and streets seemingly deserted. As the bus drove up to the station, a white mob of about 50 led by Klan leader William Chappell destroyed the bus, slashing tires, breaking windows, and bashing in the sides. Police arrived at the scene but arrested no one and led a police escort out to the city limits, where the mob promptly began their assualt again. Finally, a man named Cecil Lewallyn threw a molotov cocktail through one of the broken windows, engulfing the bus in smoke. Incredibly, all passengers were able to evacuate. During the evacuation, several of the Freedom Riders were assaulted, including Hank Thomas, who was left unconscious after being hit with a baseball bat by one of the white men. Freedom Rider Ell Cowling held their only defense in the form of a pistol, as the police sat looking on at the scene but did not attempt to make any arrests or even write down license numbers of any of the assailants&apos; cars. Finally, after police fired a shotgun into the air to disperse the crowds as the bus was engulfed in flames, the Riders were transported to the Anniston Memorial Hospital, where they were refused treatment by hospital administration and an aggitated crowd grew outside of the hospital. Luckily, a call was made to Deacon Fred Shuttlesworth, who was able to organize a rescue mission of eight cars to transport the Riders from what very well could have turned into a lynching to safety in Birmingham.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Riders-Struggle-Justice-American/dp/0195327144" target="_blank">Learn more</a>',

As the Trailway Riders left the station in Atlanta, several KKK members boarded after them, threatening violence after they crossed the Alabama border. When they entered Anniston, they began to see the wreckage of the violence done to the Greyhound bus. The bus driver John Olan Patterson stopped the bus and ordered the Black passengers to teh back of the bus. When the Freedom Riders refused, the driver and the Klansmen began attacking the Riders on the bus. The Riders held to their promise of non-violence and sat silent while the white mob beat them and dragged them to the back of the bus. After the violence, the driver avoided the Anniston mob by taking Alabama backroads to Birmingham, where an even larger, more violent obstacle waited for them. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Riders-Struggle-Justice-American/dp/0195327144" target="_blank">Learn more</a>',

The entire assualt was over in 20 minutes, and the Freedom Riders were left to cobble together transportation from any sympathetic cab drivers to Shuttlesworth&apos;s parsonage to reunite with the Greyhound Riders. After failed threats to arrest the Freedom Riders while at the parsonage, Peck was taken via ambulance to a local hospital, where he was swarmed by media who emblazened the image of his injuries across the news and referred to him as a living martyr.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Riders-Struggle-Justice-American/dp/0195327144" target="_blank"> Learn more</a>',

Kennedy, and head of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover, a flurry of political activity ensued the following day. The Kennedys attempted to negotiate with the Alabama governor Patterson to ensure safe passage for the Freedom Riders in their continued journey to New Orleans. However, most of the political action pursued on the Riders&apos; behalf stemmed mostly from political motivation, not from a civil rights perspective. When the governor refused to provide protection for the Riders, coupled with Greyhound and Trailway&apos;s refusal to provide drivers to operate the buses after the previous day&apos;s violence, the Riders felt they had no choice but to leave Alabama altogether. They flew from Birmingham to New Orleans in order to attend the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> commemoration rally in New Orleans on May 17. However, the Riders found themselves trapped for hours at the Birmingham airport when every flight they attempted to board prompted bomb threats to the airport. Eventually, the Kennedy administration sent a representative down to Birmingham in an attempt to "smuggle" the Riders out of Alabama. Eventually, the Riders were able to leave after coordination between the airlines and traffic control managed to announce departure of the flight at the last minute, sidestepping any potential bomb threats. All 14 Freedom Riders were free from Alabama miraculously with their lives, and landed in New Orleans, relieved, traumatized, and with renewed support from the federal government that would lead to Robert Kennedy&apos;s crusade to bring institutions across the country to comply with the era of desegregation.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Riders-Struggle-Justice-American/dp/0195327144" target="_blank"> Learn more</a>',
